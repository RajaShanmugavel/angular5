Placing all the trials I am experimenting with Angular5

Lifecyle of Angular Component:

ngOnChanges	-	Called after a bound input property changes

ngOnInit	-	Called once the component is initialized

ngDoCheck	-	Called during every change detection run

ngAfterContentInit	-	Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view

ngAfterContentChecked - Called every time the projected content has been checked

ngAfterViewInit	-	Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized

ngAfterViewChecked	-	Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked

ngOnDestroy	-	Called once the component is about to be destroyed
